# Overview

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The SQD ecosystem is built around [SQD Network](/subsquid-network) - a decentralized query engine and a horizontally-scalable data lake for batch queries. Currently, SQD Network serves raw historical on-chain data from [various blockchains](/subsquid-network/reference/networks) using [custom REST-like APIs](/subsquid-network/reference). In the future, it will additionally support general-purpose SQL queries and an ever-growing collection of structured data sets derived from on- and off- chain data.

## SQD Network

[SQD Network](/subsquid-network) API currently provides:

- raw event logs
- transaction data (with receipts)
- execution traces (for selected networks)
- state diffs (for selected networks)

It supports all major [EVM](/subsquid-network/reference/networks/#evm--ethereum-compatible) and [Substrate](/subsquid-network/reference/networks/#substrate-based) networks, with more in the works. [Let us know](https://t.me/HydraDevs) if you'd like us to support some other network.

Currently there are two deployments of SQD Network:

1. Production-ready [private cluster](/subsquid-network/overview/#open-private-network) running on SQD infrastructure (formerly known as Subsquid Archives). Access to the cluster is free and public.
2. A [decentralized permissionless network](/subsquid-network/overview/#permissionless-public-network), currently a testnet.

User-facing [API](/subsquid-network/reference) between these two is identical. Use it directly whenever you need historical blockchain data older than about 6-24 hours in either **(1)** high volume or **(2)** filtered form.

<details>
<summary>Example use cases for the SQD Network direct API</summary>

- boost the performance of existing pipelines by replacing per-block RPC requests with batch-requests to SQD Network
- non-Typescript indexers, mobile SDKs
- high-performance data pipelines for raw historical data
- a high-performance data source for tools like ApeWorkX, Cryo
- ad-hoc queries over historical on-chain data, such as
  * "all transactions from a given address in a range of blocks"
  * "all events with a given topic in a range of blocks"

</details>

For real-time use cases such as app-specific APIs use [Squid SDK](/sdk): it'll use SQD Network to sync quickly, then seamlessly switch to real-time data. If you already have a subgraph indexer, you also have an option to [run it against the network](/subgraphs-support).

## Squid SDK

[Squid SDK](/sdk) is a powerful Typescript toolkit for building indexers on top of SQD Network, featuring

- [High-level libraries](/sdk/reference/processors) for extracting and filtering the SQD Network data in what can be though of as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines
- [Ergonomic tools](/sdk/resources/tools/typegen) for decoding and normalizing raw data and efficiently accessing [network state](/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/state-queries)
- Pluggable [data sinks](/sdk/reference/store) to save data into Postgres, files (local or s3) or BigQuery
- An expressive [GraphQL server](/sdk/resources/serving-graphql#openreader) with a schema-based [config](/sdk/reference/schema-file)
- Seamless handling of [unfinalized blocks and chain reorganizations](/sdk/resources/unfinalized-blocks) for real-time data ingestion
- rapid data extraction and decoding [for local analytics](/sdk/tutorials/file-csv)

The SDK is a go-to choice for production solutions and prototypes of

1. custom APIs based on data from sets of smart contracts, and
2. low-cost, highly performant in-house data pipelines

that can work in real time setting (\<1s chain latency). Take a look at the list of [concrete, real-world applications](/sdk/faq/#real-world-applications) for which Squid SDK was a good fit.
## SQD Cloud

A Platform-as-a-Service for deploying Squid SDK indexers, featuring

- provisioning of [Postgres](/cloud/reference/pg) and other [compute resources](/cloud/reference/manifest) for indexers
- [zero downtime migrations](/cloud/resources/production-alias) between indexer versions
- provisioning of [high-performance RPC endpoints](/cloud/reference/rpc-proxy-networks) for real-time applications
- intuitive deployment management through a [Web application](https://app.subsquid.io) or [CLI](/squid-cli)
- Google Cloud-level [SLA](/cloud/pricing/#slas)
