`sqd prod` and the production aliases system are deprecated starting from `@subsquid/cli@3.0.0`. Zero downtime updates are now handled by the [slots and tags system](/cloud/resources/slots-and-tags). See also the [changelog](/cloud/reference/deployments-two-changelog) for a comparison between production aliases and the new system.
