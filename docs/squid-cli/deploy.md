`sqd deploy`
============

Deploy or update a squid version.

Squid name and version are taken from the provided deployment manifest.

* [`sqd deploy SOURCE`](#sqd-deploy-source)

When invoked by an account with more than one organization, this command may require specifying an [organization](/cloud/resources/organizations) with the `-o/--org` flag. The organization has to be specified when deploying a new squid, but can be omitted when deploying a new version of an existing squid.

SQD Cloud users with just one organization can omit this flag.

The command honors [`.squidignore`](/cloud/reference/squidignore) when sending squid files to the [Cloud](/cloud).

## `sqd deploy SOURCE`

Deploy a new or update an existing squid version

```
USAGE
