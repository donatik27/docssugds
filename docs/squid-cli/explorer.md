`sqd explorer`
==========

Visual explorer of deployed squids

Left pane: List of deployed squids.
Right pane: details of the selected squid. Navigate by pressing the corresponding number (e.g. `1` for Summary).

1) Summary: endpoint URL, sync status, DB storage utilization

2) Logs

3) DB access details

This command requires specifying an [organization](/cloud/resources/organizations) with the `-o/--org` flag when invoked by accounts with more than one organization. SQD Cloud users with just one organization can omit this flag.
