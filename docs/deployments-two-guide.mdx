# Guide to Deployments 2.0

You've probably read the SQD Cloud Deployments 2.0 [Release Notes](/deployments-two-release-notes), and now you’re ready to dive deeper into how it works. So let's get started!

The new deployments system is built on two new concepts:

* **Slots:** Given a squid name and an [organization](/cloud/resources/organizations), slot name uniquely identifies a squid deployment.
  - Slots directly replace versions from the old workflow. Unlike versions, they are identified by short strings, not numbers.
  - You can specify a slot on deployment or omit it. In the latter case the Cloud will create a new slot with a random identifier.
  - Deploying to an already occupied slot will result in updating the initial deployment.
* **Tags:** A way to label deployments.

  Tags rules:
  - Each tag can be assigned to only one deployment among those that have the same name + organization. Assigning an existing tag _moves_ it.
  - Multiple tags can be assigned to any one deployment.

  Tags uses:
  - Each tag added to the slot adds a new custom endpoint.
  - You can address deployments by their tags to perform various operations, including redeployment.

Both tags and slots can be specified in squid manifest as well as via command line, giving rise to a variety of possible workflows. Let's take a look at a few common scenarios.

## Zero-downtime updates

The functionality in this section mirrors the now-deprecated [production aliases](/cloud/resources/production-alias).

As you develop your squid you will sometimes need to re-sync it from scratch. With tags you can do this without a maintenance downtime. Here's how:

1. Take your squid (or the [the EVM template](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/squid-evm-template/) if you just want something to test this with) and open its manifest (`squid.yaml` by default). Remove any deployment references:

   * `version:` (old)
   * `slot:` (new)
   * `tag:` (new)

   This is needed because we'll let the Cloud auto generate a slot identifier for us. The top of your manifest file should look something like this:
   ```yaml
   manifestVersion: subsquid.io/v0.1
   name: my-squid
   description: 'The very first...
   ```

2. Deploy the squid with `sqd deploy .` while in the project folder. Once complete, you’ll see a message like this:
   ```
   =================================================
   A new squid my-org/my-squid@fj0anc has been successfully created
   =================================================
   ```
   `fj0anc` is the slot name that Cloud automatically assigned to your squid deployment. Here's how this deployment looks like in [the app](https://app.subsquid.io/squids):

   ![First squid](./deployments-two-guide-first-squid.png)

   At this stage you can already access your deployment's API via a slot-based URL. However, that API will go down if we reset the deployment's database. Instead, let us use a tag-based URL that can be redirected to an API of another deployment.

3. Assign a tag to your deployment:
   ```bash
   sqd tags add production -n my-squid -s fj0anc
   ```
   This assigns the `production` tag to the deployment, making the API accessible via:
   ```
   https://my-org.squids.live/my-squid:production/api/graphql
   ```
   Use this URL to access the API in your frontend app.

**Now, let's say you've made some changes to your codebase and need to re-sync your squid from scratch.** Follow these steps:

1. Make one more deployment of your squid. For that you can just re-run `sqd deploy .`: since no slot, version or tag is supplied in the manifest, the Cloud will automatically create a new slot for you. Your Cloud deployments might now look like this:

   ![Second squid](./deployments-two-guide-second-squid.png)

2. Wait for your new deployment to sync, then test its API using its slot-based (_canonical_) URL:
   ```
   https://my-org.squids.live/my-squid@u293zi/api/graphql
   ```

3. When you're ready to switch, simply reassign the `production` tag to the new deployment:
   ```bash
   sqd tags add production -n my-squid -s u293zi
   ```
   The tag-based URL will now point to the new deployment, `u293zi`, with the switch typically taking just a few seconds.

4. Finally, if you no longer need the old deployment, remove it by slot:
   ```bash
   sqd rm -n my-squid -s fj0anc
   ```

## Multiple major versions

One common scenario occurs when you release a breaking change and need to maintain several major versions of your API. With tags, you can keep all these major versions under the same squid name.

Let’s say you’ve introduced a breaking change to the squid from the previous example. Deploy your new version as follows:

```bash
sqd deploy .
# then, assuming that the new deployment got slot f69x40
sqd tags add production-v1 -n my-squid -s f69x40
```
Alternatively, you can use the `--add-tag` option of `sqd deploy` to do the same thing without having to handle the autogenerated slot name:
```bash
sqd deploy . --add-tag production-v1
```
This will produce exactly the same result. Here's how it may look like in the Cloud app:

![Two major versions](./deployments-two-guide-two-major-versions.png)

Now you have two independent APIs accessible by tag-based URLs and you can perform [zero-downtime updates](#zero-downtime-updates) on each.

## Development workflows

In the [previous section](#multiple-major-versions) we considered the situation when multiple tags are used to denote major versions of the API. However, the exact same approach can be used to separate, for example, development from production:

![Development and production](./deployments-two-guide-development-and-production.png)

When working on your development deployment, you’ll likely need to perform a variety of operations on it, frequently and without the concern of downtime. For that, all Squid CLI commands allow addressing deployments by tag. For example, to access logs of your `development` deployment use

```bash
sqd logs -n my-squid -t development
```
This command allows you to pull logs directly from the deployment tagged `development`, without needing to remember or specify the slot name.

Moreover, you can update your `development`-tagged deployment without having to know its slot name:
```bash
sqd deploy . -t development
```
It's even possible to ensure that whenever you deploy from the current directory, the deployment goes to the slot tagged `development`. Simply add the following line to `squid.yaml`:
```yaml
tag: development
```
This may serve as a safeguard, preventing accidental deployments to production or the creation of unintended deployments.

## Next steps

Now that you've seen how slots and tags can help you with some common tasks, you may want to use them to design new workflows uniquely suitable for the needs of your project. Here are some resources that may help you with that:

- The output of `sqd <command> --help` commands, especially of
  ```bash
  sqd deploy --help
  ```
  All the flags you can use to refer to deployments and to disable protective user prompts are described there.

- The detailed [changelog](/deployments-two-changelog) that (for now) doubles as the reference documentation page. It describes the new system by comparing it to the old one that was based on versions and [production aliases](/cloud/resources/production-alias).

- If you used the old system or witnessed the migration of your organization, you may want to take a look at the [Backwards compatibility](/deployments-two-changelog/#backwards-compatibility) section of the changelog.
