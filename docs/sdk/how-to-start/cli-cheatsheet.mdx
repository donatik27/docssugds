# Squid CLI cheatsheet

The [`sqd` CLI tool](/squid-cli/) has [built-in aliasing](/squid-cli/commands-json) that picks up the commands defined in `commands.json` in the project root. In all [squid templates](/sdk/how-to-start/squid-development/#templates) this file is pre-populated with some handy scripts briefly described below.

One can always inspect the available commands defined in `commands.json` with
```
sqd --help
```
The commands defined by `commands.json` will appear in the `SQUID COMMANDS` help sections.

Before using the `sqd` CLI tool, make sure all the project dependencies are installed:
```sh
npm i
```

### Building the squid

```sh
sqd build             Build the squid project
sqd clean             Delete all build artifacts
```

### Running the squid

:::info
Both `sqd up` and `sqd down` assume that the `docker compose` command is supported and the `docker` deamon is running. Modify the definitions in `commands.json` accordingly if `docker-compose` should be used instead.
:::

```
sqd up                  Start a local PG database
sqd down                Drop the local PG database
sqd run [PATH]          Run all the services defined in squid.yaml locally
sqd serve               Start the GraphQL server
sqd serve:prod          Start the GraphQL API server with caching and limits
```

### DB migrations

Read [TypeORM Migration generation](/sdk/resources/tools/migrations-gen/) for details.

```
sqd migration:apply             apply pending migrations
sqd migration:generate          generate the migration for the schema defined in schema.graphql
sqd migration:clean             clean the db/migrations folder 
```

### Code generation

Consult [TypeORM Model generation](/sdk/resources/tools/model-gen/) for TypeORM model generation details, and [Type-safe decoding](https://docs.subsquid.io/sdk/resources/tools/typegen/) for type generation.

:::info
Depending on the template, `sqd typegen` is aliased to a different typegen tool specific to the chain type and thus has different usage. Consult `sqd typegen --help` for details.
:::

```
sqd codegen        Generate TypeORM entities from schema.graphql
sqd typegen        Generate data access classes for an ABI file(s) in the ./abi folder
```
